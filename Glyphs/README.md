# iOS 15.4 shortcut and folder glyphs

## Issues

- Pairs of glyphs with the same name: Feed, Loading Indicator, and Target (only the first one in folders)
- The two-pill glyph is repeated under the names "Pills" and "Pill"
- There's a typo in the English name of glyph #61576 ("Outine" instead of "Outline")
